"""
Evaluate unobstructed solar radiation on a surface facing any direction
at every timestep of a Wea.

-

    Args:
        _wea: A Honeybee Wea object.
        _alt_: A number between -90 and 90 that represents the altitude at which
            radiation is being evaluated in degrees.
            A value of 0 denotes a surface facing the horizon and a value of
            90 denotes a surface is facing straight up. Default is 90 for straight up.
        _az_: A number between 0 and 360 that represents the azimuth at which
            radiation is being evaluated in degrees.
            A value of 0 means North, 90 means East, 180 means South, and
            270 means West.  Default is 180 for south facing.
        _g_ref_: A number between 0 and 1 that represents the ground reflectance.
            Default is set to 0.2.
        iso_t_: Set to "True" to use an isotropic sky model, which assumes that
            diffuse radiation is evenly distributed across the sky and is 
            suitable for both cloudy and clear skies.  Set to "False" to use
            an anisotropic sky model, that places more diffuse radiation near
            the solar disc and is more accourate for clear skies but is not 
            suitable for cloudy skies.  The default is set to "True" of an 
            isotropic sky model.
    Returns:
        readMe!: Reports, errors, warnings, etc.
        total: A list of total solar irradiance at each timestep of the WEA.
        dir: A list of direct solar irradiance at each timestep of the WEA.
        diff: A list of diffuse solar irradiance at each timestep of the WEA.
        ref: A list of ground reflected solar irradiance at each
            timestep of the WEA.
