"""
Radiance Opaque Material from Single Reflectance Value

-

    Args:
        _name: Material name as a text string.
        _reflect_: Diffuse reflectance as a number between 0 and 1.
        _spec_: Fraction of reflected light that is specular. The reflected specularity
            of common uncoated glass is around .06, Matte = suggested min 0,
            Satin = suggested max 0.07 (Default: 0). Specularity fractions
            greater than 0.1 are not realistic (Default: 0).
        _rough_: Roughness is specified as the rms slope of surface facets.
            A value of 0 corresponds to a perfectly smooth surface, and a 
            value of 1 would be a very rough surface. Roughness values 
            greater than 0.2 are not very realistic. (Default: 0).
    Returns:
        material: Radiance opaque material
