Honeybee Surface

-

    Args:
        _geo: A list of input geometries.
        names_: A name or a list of names for input geometry. If the name is not
            provided Honeybee will assign a random name to the surface.
        _type_: Surface type. Surface type will be used to set the material and
            construction for the surface if they are not assigned by user.
            0   Wall           0.5 UndergroundWall
            1   Roof           1.5 UndergroundCeiling
            2   Floor          2.25 UndergroundSlab
            2.5 SlabOnGrade    2.75 ExposedFloor
            3   Ceiling        4   AirWall
            5   Window         6   Context
        radMat_: Radiance material. If radiance matrial is not provided the component
            will use the type to assign the default material for the surface. If type
            is also not assigned by user. Honeybee will guess the type of the surface
            based on surface normal vector direction at the center of the surface.
        epProp_: EnergyPlus properties. If EnergyPlus properties is not provided the
            component will use the "type" to assign the EnergyPlus properties for this
            surface. If type is also not assigned by user Honeybee will guess the type
            of the surface based on surface normal vector direction at the center of
            the surface, and sets EnergyPlus properties based on the type.
        
    Returns:
        report: Reports, errors, warnings, etc.
        HBSrf: Honeybee surface. Use this surface directly for daylight simulation
            or to create a Honeybee zone for Energy analysis.
