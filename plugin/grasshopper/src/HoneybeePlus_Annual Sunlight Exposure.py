"""
Calculate annual sunlight exposure (ASE).

As per IES-LM-83-12, ASE is the percent of sensors that are
found to be exposed to more than 1000lux of direct sunlight for
more than 250hrs per year. For LEED credits no more than 10% of
the points in the grid should fail this measure.
-

    Args:
        _analysis_grid: An analysis grid output from run Radiance analysis.
        blind_states_: List of state ids for all the sources for input hoys.
            If you want a source to be removed set the state to -1. ASE must
            be calculated without dynamic blinds but you can use this option
            to study the effect of different blind states.
        _occ_schedule_: An annual occupancy schedule.
        _threshold_: Threshhold for solar exposure in lux (default: 1000).
        _target_hrs_: Minimum target hours for each point (default: 250).
        _target_area_: Minimum target area percentage for this grid (default: 10)

    Returns:
        report: Reports, errors, warnings, etc.
        success: True if you meet target area based on target hours.
        ASE: Number of hours of annual sunlight exposure for each test point.
        per_area: Percentage area that doesn't meet the target.
        prblm_pts: A list of problematic test points.
        prblm_hrs: Problematic hours for each point.
        legend_par: Suggested legend parameters for Annual Sunlight Exposure.
